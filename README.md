# Sales-Marketing-Analytics-Dashboard
To design and develop an interactive Power BI Sales &amp; Marketing Dashboard that provides insights into product performance, profit distribution, regional sales trends, customer behaviour, and discount impact. The objective is to enable data-driven decision-making for sales, marketing, and inventory management.
#  Project Overview

This project analyzes multi-year sales performance across categories, subcategories, regions, and customer segments. Using Power BI, the dashboard delivers real-time KPIs, trend analysis, top/bottom product insights, profit vs. discount behaviour, and region-wise profitability.

The report supports strategic business decisions by highlighting sales drivers, low-performing segments, and improvement opportunities.

#  Business Tasks / Key Questions Answered

Which products or regions are underperforming?

What is the relationship between discounts and profitability?

Which states/regions contribute the most to total revenue?

How do sales vary monthly and yearly (trend analysis)?

Which customer segments and products drive business peaks?

What actions can improve profitability and optimize inventory?
